For helping Airbnb, Shopify, and other companies chart a path to net-zero emissions Watershed helps companies, such as Shopify, Stripe, and Sweetgreen, decarbonize their businesses, from their direct operations to their entire supply chain. Its software analyzes a company's carbon emissions to build a climate-impact plan; such as Square's December 2020 announcement of its net-zero target by 2030, including efforts to transition Bitcoin mining to renewable energy sources. Watershed's data is instrumental in helping customers go to their biggest suppliers to pressure them to clean up their emissions. It also has created a marketplace where its customers can buy clean power and invest in carbon-removal projects-with Watershed's software guiding companies to the solutions that will help them reach their goals. The startup, which hatched in 2019, only officially launched in February 2021, attracting additional high-profile customers, such as Airbnb, Expensify, and Vimeo.

309,20220323T184457,"Moderna will seek emergency authorization of its vaccine for young children. Moderna is also studying booster shots for all three age groups younger than 18. Moderna said on Wednesday that it would seek emergency authorization of its coronavirus vaccine for children younger than 6, after interim results from its clinical trial showed that volunteers in that age group had a similar immune response to young adults when given a dose one-fourth as strong. But the firm said the vaccine proved only about 44 percent effective in preventing symptomatic illness among children 6 months to 2 years old, and 37 percent effective in children 2 through 5 years old. The company is studying the effectiveness of a booster shot, and one of its top officials said she expects a booster will be necessary for that age group, just as it is for adults. Dr. Jacqueline Miller, the firm's senior vice president for infectious diseases, said that the relatively low level of protection demonstrated the ability of the Omicron variant to evade the vaccine's shield. Nonetheless, she said in an interview, ""What we have seen is a successful trial."" ""What I will say is 37.5 percent and 43.7 percent are higher than zero,"" she said. ""If I were the parent of a young child, I would want there to be some protection on board, especially if we see another wave of infections."" The firm's announcement comes shortly before Pfizer and BioNTech are expected to release results from a three-shot study for children under five, using doses one-tenth as strong as those for people 12 and older. Those results are expected in April. At the request of the F.D.A., Pfizer-BioNTech last month submitted preliminary results from their trial; regulators hoped the data on two doses would be strong enough to get the vaccination campaign underway while awaiting final results on three. But the F.D.A. changed its mind when new data, collected during the Omicron surge, showed convincingly that two doses failed to protect adequately against symptomatic infection. Pfizer and BioNTech did not publicly release the exact results, but in December, they reported that two doses of their vaccine produced a strong immune response in children 6 months to 2 years old, but not in those 2 through 4 years old. Children under 5, a group of about 18 million, are the only Americans still not eligible for shots. In a statement, St√©phane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive officer, said the company will also request emergency authorization for its two-shot vaccine for children 6 to 11, and was updating a similar request that it filed last summer for those 12 to 17. That request was put on hold because the Food and Drug Administration wanted to see more data on a rare side effect, myocarditis, which involves inflammation of the heart. So far, Pfizer-BioNTech's shot is the only one authorized for Americans 5 through 17. About 6,900 children in the United States and Canada were enrolled in Moderna's trial for those under 6. Moderna said there were no cases of severe illness, hospitalization or death in either the placebo or the vaccine arm. The majority of infections were mild. The children who received the vaccine demonstrated a comparable response in the level of neutralizing antibodies as adults aged 18 to 25, meeting the primary endpoint set by the F.D.A. for a successful trial, the firm said. Because of the Omicron surge, there were enough infections to also evaluate the vaccine's efficacy against symptomatic disease, Moderna said. The relatively low efficacy comports with research on how well vaccines have protected adults from the Omicron variant, it said. Moderna is studying booster shots for all three age groups under 18. ""We certainly intend to administer a booster dose to these children,"" Dr. Miller said. ""And recall that we found that we needed to administer a booster dose to adults in order to maintain high levels of vaccine efficacy against the Omicron variant."" The majority of side effects were mild or moderate and fever rates were typical of existing pediatric vaccines. A few children- .2 percent of the study group - developed fevers greater than 104 degrees, the firm said.",neutral

1144,20220503T143700,"We currently exist in one of those weeks that will wind up being a big deal, one way or the other. Between a massive haul of quarterly earnings reports, big monthly jobs numbers to be released, and of course a hugely consequential Fed meeting today and tomorrow that will determine monetary policy going forward, it could all line up to something of a perfect storm for the markets. Consensus is now that the Fed will hike interest rates half a percentage point, which will bring the bank-to-bank rate to between 0.75-1.00%. Actual retail bank customers looking for loans are already paying much more than this, including an average 5.4% 30-year fixed mortgage rate. So will this actual raise  (  to still historically low interest rate levels  )  push these loan rates even higher in the near-term? That's what the Fed wants to see, as it will then add to the price tag of a home, car, etc. with the idea that it will eventually suppress prices, thereby curbing inflation. Tomorrow's statement and presser will also likely deal with a method for draining some $9 trillion in assets from the Fed's balance sheet - a result of many months worth of backstopping the economy from the start of the pandemic reaching American shores. Just how this gets drawn down ought to have some impact on market participants. After the opening bell this morning, we see a new JOLTS report for March which documents existing jobs in the domestic labor market, as well as job ""quits.""  (  These came in at 11.3 million and 4.4 million, respectively, the previous month.  )  Also Factory Orders and Motor Vehicle Sales - for March, as well - will give us the status of goods productivity and high-end consumer purchases, which will provide more grist for the Fed's mill this week. Pfizer  (  PFE Quick QuotePFE - Free Report  )  shares are flat after the Big Pharma staple missed Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines in its Q1 report this morning, with earnings of $1.62 per share light of expectations by 4 cents, and revenues of $25.66 billion beneath the $26.49 billion analysts were looking for. Covid sales guidance for full-year 2022 were higher than expected: $32 billion for the vaccine, $22 billion for its preventative antiviral. Yet full-year earnings estimates were lower than previous expectations. BP  (  BP Quick QuoteBP - Free Report  )  put up a mixed Q1 report this morning, after taking a whopping $20.4 billion loss from the company pulling out its 20% ownership of Russia's Rosneft oil company, which it did three days after President Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine. Earnings of $1.92 per ADS beat the Zacks consensus by more than 50 cents, while revenues of $51.22 billion came up short of the $53.13 billion we were looking for. The company also offers a dividend of $5.46 per share. Shares are up nearly +5% on the news. Estee Lauder  (  EL Quick QuoteEL - Free Report  )  shares are falling almost -10% on its fiscal Q3 release ahead of today's opening bell. Earnings of $1.90 per share marks a big beat over the $1.66 expected, while sales of $4.25 billion in the quarter missed estimates by -1.8%.
