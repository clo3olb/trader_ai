( Win McNamee/Getty Images )  America's oil and gas industry says it supports President Biden's plan to ban Russian oil, natural gas, and coal imports into the US. ""Our industry is prepared to comply with the import ban in response to this aggression,"" said Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the powerful American Petroleum Institute, on Tuesday, referring to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""The industry has already taken significant and meaningful steps to unwind relationships, both with respect to assets in Russia, as well as imports of Russian crude oil and refined products. We share the goal of reducing reliance on foreign energy sources and urge policymakers to advance American energy leadership and expand domestic production to counter Russia's influence in global energy markets."" Some context: Russia accounts for a small amount of the total energy imports into the US - about 8% last year. The API is the largest trade group for the U.S. oil and gas industry, whose members include Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP and Shell. Shell announced earlier on Tuesday that it will stop purchasing Russian crude oil and completely withdraw from the Russian energy industry ""aligned with new government guidance."" In his speech Tuesday, Biden acknowledged the oil and gas firms pulling out of Russia, but once again warned companies not to take advantage of soaring oil costs to raise prices and pad profits. Sommers told CNN in an interview last month that U.S. oil companies would not seek to capitalize on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying his members want to do what's best for consumers around the world.",neutral

The relatively muted Russian activity in cyberspace is due to defensive measures from the Ukrainians, ""some of the challenges that the Russians have encountered, and some of the work that others have been able to prevent their actions,"" said Nakasone, who also heads US Cyber Command, said at the House Intelligence Committee's worldwide threats hearing. US officials have watched and tracked ""very carefully"" three of four of the Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine, Nakasone said without elaborating. US national security officials from multiple agencies have provided Ukrainian officials with cybersecurity assistance to track threats and recover from hacking incidents. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, there were a series of cyberattacks that disrupted the websites of Ukrainian government agencies and, in other cases, wiped data from agency networks. The White House blamed Russia's GRU military agency for the first set of website-disrupting cyberattacks that occurred in January. Moscow denied the allegation.

Burns said the US will monitor Putin's domestic popularity as the war in Ukraine continues but cautioned that Putin's control of the media will help stave him stave off some popular unrest.
