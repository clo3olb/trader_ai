It was May 2012, and the Australians, both in their mid-twenties, had flown from Sydney to Silicon Valley six months earlier to raise money from investors on Sand Hill Road. The couple had met as teens at the University of Western Australia in Perth. Neither had formally studied the discipline of design  ( Perkins had majored in communications, Obrecht in education ) , but Perkins had tutored other students in Photoshop in her spare time and had become fascinated by tools that made design more accessible to, well, self-described Luddites like Obrecht. Together, they had launched Fusion Books, an online yearbook-design product that was chugging along back home. They'd come to California with a simple pitch: They needed funds to build a platform that would allow anyone to design just about anything, all within a single interface. Instead, they received more than 100 rejections. That afternoon, the final name on their once-promising spreadsheet of VCs had turned red. So, the usually optimistic pair went on a ""misery walk,"" recalls Obrecht, to decide if they had run out of options. After three hours of soul-searching, they determined they hadn't. ""We got up the next morning and just started back at it,"" he says. Within a few months, they raised the first part of what would become a $3 million seed round.

78,20220308T110026,"On an icy gray morning in December, which held the promise of snow, BlocPower cofounder and CEO Donnel Baird arrived at City Hall in Ithaca, New York, to face one of the biggest tests yet in his effort to help American cities decarbonize their neighborhoods. For years, Baird, a former community organizer, had been pitching venture capitalists on his vision to electrify buildings by installing technologies like heat pumps and solar panels. BlocPower would play a dual role, acting as an implementation partner for local governments and utilities sponsoring decarbonization initiatives, and as a lender and project manager for homeowners and landlords looking to eliminate emissions through electrification. Though Baird had raised more than $20 million in venture funding from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Kapor Capital, he'd also met ample skeptics along the way. How could BlocPower turn every home into the equivalent of a Tesla, some investors asked, when Baird was determined to focus on buildings in low- and middle-income communities? In New York City, Baird had demonstrated the viability of his plan through retrofits to more than 800 multifamily apartment buildings, 250 single-family homes, and more than 100 houses of worship and small businesses. Now he had a chance to make good on the full scope of his vision. Earlier in the year, city leaders in Ithaca had approved an ambitious plan to become carbon-neutral by 2030, and they had selected BlocPower to help them implement energy-efficiency retrofits and replace existing heating and cooling systems with heat pumps. The first phase of the city's plans called for BlocPower to decarbonize and electrify 1,600 buildings, including 1,000 homes. To do so, though, the startup would have to win over local residents, who would be eligible through BlocPower for equipment leases or low-interest loans designed, with the help of government incentives, to make installing and leasing climate-friendly home technologies affordable to all. Baird had a long list of people to meet and neighborhoods to visit from across Ithaca, a progressive university city with a poverty rate approaching 40%.",neutral
79,20220308T110029,"The workplace became a fraught battleground in the second year of the pandemic, with employees seeing opportunities to rethink what they want out of work and participating in the Great Resignation, as it became known, and employers often engaging in tentative efforts to define a new normal while COVID-19 and its variants wreaked havoc with even the best-laid plans. Within this charged environment, we sought to identify the companies that were either providing the kind of tools that were designed to create a thriving, positive environment regardless of whether work was in-person, hybrid, or fully remote, or that inherently understood the nature of this tumult and adapted its policies and approach to serve employees. On top of those trends, we are always on the lookout for the forefront in benefits and tools that enhance work. To these ends, our honorees for the most innovative workplace companies this year include Miro, whose virtual whiteboard service expanded to meet the growing needs of enterprises to host large-scale meetings and guide even the smallest kickoff gathering to ultimate success. Dialpad, Atlassian, Slack, and Hopin all made meaningful strides in furthering digital communication that can adapt to a variety of workplace scenarios.

In the case of maternal mortality, that means creating a software that can record scans from an ultrasound wand as it glides over a pregnant woman's stomach, and then analyze those images for potential fetal abnormalities or other signals that something is wrong. Globally, the maternal mortality rate is 152 deaths per 100,000 births, according to the Gates Foundation, and a 2016 National Vital Statistics report found that 15% of women in the U.S. who gave birth received inadequate prenatal care. The WHO recommends women have at least an ultrasound before 24 weeks gestation. Ultrasound imaging requires fairly high level of expertise and requires a technician or nurse to make an initial assessment, before handing it off to a doctor. Google is suggesting that its technology could provide the technical expertise instead. ""The idea is that we think we can actually help a relatively untrained operator get some of the basics,"" says Greg Corrado, senior research director at Google.

Theoretically, it will be an open, shared experience that's at least vaguely akin to virtual reality, augmented reality, or some combination thereof-a digital environment that we feel like we're living inside, rather than observing on a screen. But for all the relentless hype the metaverse is getting, it's dependent on the entire industry settling on a bevy of complex technical standards that aren't even works-in-progress at the moment. As The Washington Post's Will Oremus wrote last December, ""The metaverse doesn't exist yet, and it probably won't anytime soon."" For now, discussions of life in the metaverse-from fashion trends to competitive sports-generally turn out to involve existing proprietary virtual worlds such as Roblox, Minecraft, and the venerable proto-metaverse Second Life. Or, in some cases, they're unabashedly speculative, such as Anna Wiener's recent New Yorker look at money in the metaverse. Still, that isn't stopping metaverse boosters from telling us what it's going to be like-most notably Mark Zuckerberg, the guy whose enthusiasm for the concept led him to rename his entire company after it. To find a comparable era of technologists treating an idea as if it's a reality, you need to reach back to the early-to-mid 1990s. That's when the buzzword they obsessed over was the ""information superhighway""-the national high-speed computing network that would revolutionize how consumers shopped, kept themselves informed and entertained, and a whole lot more. And on November 14, 1994, at the COMDEX trade show, Microsoft's Bill Gates dedicated his keynote to ""this next era that we're moving into,"" with an on-stage presentation interspersed with chunks of a high-tech crime drama set in the futuristic year of 2005.

Jedlička is the founder and president of the Free Republic of Liberland, but despite the unlikely prospects of his micronational dreams, he didn't just opt for any podunk, cut-rate design to shine a glimmer of feasibility on this longshot. Instead, he went to Zaha Hadid Architects, founded by the late Pritzker Prize-winning architect and one of the highest-profile architecture firms in the world. The firm was hired to create an urban plan for Liberland and mock up the early-stage schematics for what would be its first buildings. The buildings ZHA has designed, with the firm's trademark swirls and curves, are one way that Liberland does indeed exist. And thanks to the video game-esque space known as the metaverse, the buildings can be visited virtually.

AI and IoT are quickly becoming the leading factors in the growth of smart home markets. Smart living with automation and integrated AI-IoT is no longer considered as a luxury as home automation tools have become more affordable. Home automation and smart homes are two ambiguous terms used in reference to a wide range of monitoring solutions, controlling, and automating functions in a home. Unlike simple home automation solutions  ( which could range from motor-operated garage doors to automated security systems ) , smart home systems require a web portal or a smartphone application as a user interface to interact with an automated system. Smart home devices are suitable for a home setup where devices can be automatically controlled distantly from any Internet-connected place in the world, using a mobile or other networked device. A smart home has its devices connected through the Internet, and the customer can regulate functions, such as security access to the house, temperature, lighting, and home theater. A report from Mordor Intelligence projected that the Global Smart Homes Market was valued at USD 79.13 billion in 2021, and it is expected to reach USD 313.95 billion by 2027 and register a CAGR of 25.3% over the forecast period  ( 2022 - 2027 ) . It said: ""Across real estate companies and the architect ecosystem, the 'new normal' defined through the social distancing results in a requirement to go back to the redesign basics and reinvent the residential real estate product by factoring in new-age designing, efficiency, and innovation. As the redesign happens, the need for a totally new set of amenities has resurfaced and gained prominence. What the customer will need in the 'new normal' has undergone a revolution in the crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is leading to a paradigm shift in residential spaces.""

""The difference is, when a rainforest tree falls down, it returns 97% of the carbon back to the atmosphere, whereas we can sequester all of it."" The production at the test site varies, as the company runs different trials. But when it builds the first commercial-scale plant, covering 1,000 acres, it expects to remove 40,000 tons of CO2 per year, roughly the equivalent emissions of using 92,000 barrels of oil. Scaled up to cover available desert land on coasts, the system could hypothetically remove 2 gigatons of CO2 a year. The company pumps seawater from the nearby coast into its facility, taking advantage of the fact that the water is filled both with nutrients that algae needs to grow and with CO2; the ocean has absorbed tens of billions of tons of CO2 emissions over the last few decades. As the water flows through a series of containers and ponds, algae grows in the startup's proprietary system and captures carbon. When the algae is ready to be harvested-a process that takes between 18 and 30 days-it's filtered out of the water, which is returned to the ocean.  ( The process also makes the water less acidic, helping solve another problem caused by climate change. )  Then the algae is dried and buried under the sand, where the carbon it captures can be permanently stored. It's one example of something that climate science says is necessary: Tackling climate change involves not only moving away from fossil fuels and eliminating other emissions, but also removing CO2 from the air. The latest IPCC report says that carbon removal-both through technology and natural solutions like planting trees- is essential and will have to massively grow for the world to have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius.",neutral

The goal of the initiative, reports Insider, is for the ads to be integrated into the games, such as appearing on digital billboards in a sports stadium. The decision on whether to include ads will apparently be up to the developer, meaning you're less likely to see a promotion for Mountain Dew or Takis in big, AAA titles like Call of Duty or God of War. But smaller, independent games-especially those that utilize the free-to-play model-could embrace the ads. In-game advertising has been a hot-button issue in the core gaming world for more than two decades. In 2002, Simon & Schuster Interactive published Darkened Skye, a 3-D action fantasy game that featured a lot of what players expected in these games at the time: Ancient worlds, nefarious enemies, and buxom heroines. But it also had some blatant product placement, requiring players to collect Skittles candy to gain mana. The entire game was set in worlds depicted in Skittles commercials at the time.",neutral

He had worked to try to pass a cap-and-trade law in the state of Washington, but the bill failed, leading him to feel frustrated with the political process-and to think more about the potential of working in industry. By 2016, as transportation surpassed electricity as the biggest source of emissions in the U.S., ""transportation was sort of in the crosshairs for everybody in the climate community,"" he says. Part of making transportation more climate-friendly will come from walkable neighborhoods and better public transit. But Reeder knew that car companies like Audi would also have to fundamentally change, pivoting from a long history of making internal combustion engines, or ICEs.  ( Audi is among the oldest automakers, having spun out of a company first founded in 1899. )  In 2018, he sat down with the president of Audi of America at the time, Scott Chico, to interview for the company's sustainability director job. ""I looked him in the eye and we interviewed each other, essentially,"" he says. ""I just said, how serious are you about making this pivot to electric vehicles? And how serious are you about the underlying context that this is a climate imperative-like, you're not just doing this because Tesla's your competitor, and this is sort of a cool business opportunity. . . .
